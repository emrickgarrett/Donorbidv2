# DonorBid

Donorbid.com is a school project meant to show an understanding of databases and connecting them with a project that we create. This project specifically will be an ecommerce site that will allow buyers and sellers to donate a percentage of the transaction towards a Non-Profit of their choice.

More information on the project may come up towards the end of the semester when the project is ready to be turned in, as well as having a virtual droplet on digitalocean that will be hosting a prototype that other students can interact with during our presentation.
